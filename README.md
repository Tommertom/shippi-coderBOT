# Shippi - AI-Powered Development Platform

This repository contains the core technology that powers **Shippi** - an innovative AI-powered development platform that enables interactive terminal sessions and AI coding assistance through Telegram.

## What is Shippi?

Shippi leverages **coderBOT** technology to provide developers with secure, remote access to AI coding assistants (GitHub Copilot, Claude, Cursor) directly through Telegram. This creates a seamless workflow for coding, debugging, and managing projects from anywhere.

## The Technology: coderBOT

The underlying technology, **coderBOT**, provides:

- üñ•Ô∏è **Interactive Terminal Access** - Full terminal sessions via Telegram with PTY support
- ü§ñ **AI Coding Assistant Integration** - Works with GitHub Copilot CLI, Claude CLI, Cursor CLI, or any command-line AI tool
- üîê **Robust Security** - Environment-based authentication with auto-kill on unauthorized access
- üì∏ **Visual Feedback** - Real-time terminal screenshots using Puppeteer
- üìÅ **Media Management** - Automatic file watching and delivery
- üîÑ **Session Management** - Multiple concurrent sessions with intelligent timeout handling
- üéÆ **Administrative Control** - ControlBOT for managing worker processes

## Quick Start

### Option 1: Run with npx (Fastest)

```bash
# Run instantly with npx
npx @tommertom/coderbot@latest
```

On first run, it will create a `.env` file for configuration. See the [coderBOT directory](../coderBOT/) for full documentation.

### Option 2: Run with Docker

To run coderBOT in a containerized environment:

1. **Create a `.env` file** in the project root with your configuration:
   ```bash
   # Required: Your Telegram Bot Token
   TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN=your_bot_token_here
   
   # Optional: Additional configuration
   # ALLOWED_CHAT_IDS=123456789,987654321
   ```

2. **Build and start the container**:
   ```bash
   docker-compose up -d
   ```

3. **View logs**:
   ```bash
   docker-compose logs -f
   ```

4. **Stop the container**:
   ```bash
   docker-compose down
   ```

The Docker setup includes:
- Pre-installed GitHub CLI and Copilot CLI
- Persistent logs in `./logs` directory
- Automatic media file management
- Auto-restart on failure
